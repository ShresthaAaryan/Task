Kanban Board
A drag-and-drop Kanban board built with React, TypeScript, and @dnd-kit for task and column management. This project allows users to create, edit, and organize tasks across multiple columns, with persistent state saved to localStorage.

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

Technology Choices and Rationale
1. React
Why? React is a widely-used, component-based library that makes it easy to build reusable UI components and manage state efficiently.

Rationale: React's declarative nature and virtual DOM make it ideal for building interactive UIs like a Kanban board.

2. TypeScript
Why? TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, reducing runtime errors and improving code maintainability.

Rationale: TypeScript is particularly useful for larger projects where type safety and developer tooling are critical.

3. @dnd-kit
Why? @dnd-kit is a modern, lightweight library for drag-and-drop functionality in React.

Rationale: It provides a flexible and performant API for handling drag-and-drop interactions, making it perfect for a Kanban board.

4. LocalStorage
Why? LocalStorage is used to persist the state of the Kanban board across page reloads.

Rationale: It’s a simple and effective way to store data locally without requiring a backend.

5. Lucide Icons
Why? Lucide provides a clean and consistent set of icons for actions like adding tasks and columns.

Rationale: It’s lightweight and easy to integrate with React.

Known Limitations/Trade-offs
1. LocalStorage Limitations
Limitation: LocalStorage has a size limit of 5-10MB (depending on the browser), which may not be sufficient for very large boards.

Trade-off: While LocalStorage is simple to implement, it’s not scalable for large datasets. A backend database would be more appropriate for production use.

2. No Backend
Limitation: The project currently lacks a backend, so data is not shared across devices or users.

Trade-off: This simplifies the setup but limits collaboration and data persistence across sessions.

3. Basic UI/UX
Limitation: The UI is functional but lacks advanced features like animations, themes, or responsive design.

Trade-off: The focus was on core functionality (drag-and-drop and task management), with room for future UI enhancements.

4. No User Authentication
Limitation: There’s no user authentication, so all data is stored locally and accessible to anyone using the browser.

Trade-off: This keeps the project simple but limits its use in multi-user environments.

Future Improvements
1. Backend Integration
Add a backend (e.g., Node.js with Express or Firebase) to store data in a database and enable multi-user collaboration.

2. User Authentication
Implement user authentication (e.g., using Firebase Auth or Auth0) to allow users to save and access their boards securely.

3. Responsive Design
Improve the UI to make it fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

4. Advanced Animations
Add smooth animations for drag-and-drop interactions using libraries like Framer Motion.

5. Task Filters and Search
Add filtering and search functionality to help users find specific tasks quickly.

6. Column Customization
Allow users to customize column colors, titles, and other properties.

7. Export/Import Data
Add functionality to export and import board data (e.g., as JSON or CSV).

8. Real-Time Collaboration
Use WebSockets or a real-time database (e.g., Firebase Realtime Database) to enable real-time collaboration between users.

9. Task Due Dates and Reminders
Add due dates, reminders, and notifications for tasks.

10. Theming and Dark Mode
Add support for themes and a dark mode for better user experience.
